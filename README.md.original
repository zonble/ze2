# ![Application Icon for Edit](./assets/edit.svg) Edit

A simple editor for simple needs.

This editor pays homage to the classic [MS-DOS Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), but with a modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code. The goal is to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/microsoft-edit.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/microsoft-edit/versions)

You can also download binaries from [our Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases/latest).

### Windows

You can install the latest version with WinGet:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Edit
```

### Linux (build from source)

If your distribution does not provide binaries, or if you'd like to build your own, you can use our install script, provided you have installed:
* Rust (via `rustup` or similar)
* A C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
* ICU (e.g. libicu78, libicu, icu)
* curl/wget and tar

The following command will then install `msedit` into `~/.local/bin`:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/edit/main/assets/install.sh | sh
```

Additional flags are `--dev`, to build directly from the main branch, and `--system` to install into `/usr/local/bin`. For instance:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/edit/main/assets/install.sh | sh -s -- --dev --system
```

### macOS

You can install the latest version with Homebrew:
```sh
brew install msedit
```

## Build Instructions

* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Clone the repository
* If you're using nightly Rust:
  ```sh
  cargo build --release --config .cargo/release.toml
  ```
* If you're using stable Rust:
  * Ideally: Set the environment variable `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` and use the **nightly** build instructions above.
    This is recommended, because it drastically reduces the binary size and slightly improves performance.
  * Otherwise, simply run:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

### Build Configuration

You can set the following environment variables at build-time to configure the build:

Environment variable | Description
--- | ---
`EDIT_CFG_ICU*` | See [ICU library name (SONAME)](#icu-library-name-soname) below for details. Linux package maintainers are advised to review and configure these options.
`EDIT_CFG_LANGUAGES` | A comma-separated list of languages to include in the build. See [i18n/edit.toml](i18n/edit.toml) for available languages.

## Notes to Package Maintainers

### Package Naming

The canonical executable name is "edit" and the alternative name is "msedit".
We're aware of the potential conflict of "edit" with existing commands and recommend alternatively naming packages and executables "msedit".
Names such as "ms-edit" should be avoided.
Assigning an "edit" alias is recommended, if possible.

### ICU library name (SONAME)

This project optionally depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality.

By default, the project will look for the following library names:

 Variable | Windows | macOS | Linux / Other
----------|---------|-------|---------------
`EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME` | `icuuc.dll` | `libicucore.dylib` | `libicuuc.so`
`EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME` | `icuin.dll` | `libicucore.dylib` | `libicui18n.so`

If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUUC_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicuuc.so.76`.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICUI18N_SONAME`:
  For instance, `libicui18n.so.76`.

Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports symbols without `_` prefix and without version suffix, such as `u_errorName`.
If your installation uses versioned exports, please set:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_CPP_EXPORTS`:
  If set to `true`, it'll look for C++ symbols such as `_u_errorName`.
  Enabled by default on macOS.
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION`:
  If set to a version number, such as `76`, it'll look for symbols such as `u_errorName_76`.

Finally, you can set the following environment variables:
* `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_AUTO_DETECT`:
  If set to `true`, the executable will try to detect the `EDIT_CFG_ICU_RENAMING_VERSION` value at runtime.
  The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon.
  Enabled by default on UNIX (excluding macOS) if no other options are set.

To test your build settings, run `cargo test` with the `--ignored` flag. For instance:
```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```
