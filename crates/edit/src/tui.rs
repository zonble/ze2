//! An immediate mode UI framework for terminals.
//!
//! # Why immediate mode?
//!
//! This uses an "immediate mode" design, similar to [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
//! The reason for this is that I expect the UI needs for any terminal application to be
//! fairly minimal, and for that purpose an immediate mode design is much simpler to use.
//!
//! So what's "immediate mode"? The primary alternative is called "retained mode".
//! The difference is that when you create a button in this framework in one frame,
//! and you stop telling this framework in the next frame, the button will vanish.
//! When you use a regular retained mode UI framework, you create the button once,
//! set up callbacks for when it is clicked, and then stop worrying about it.
//!
//! The downside of immediate mode is that your UI code _may_ become cluttered.
//! The upside however is that you cannot leak UI elements, you don't need to
//! worry about lifetimes nor callbacks, and that simple UIs are simple to write.
//!
//! More importantly though, the primary reason for this is that the
//! lack of callbacks means we can use this design across a plain C ABI,
//! which we'll need once plugins come into play. GTK's `g_signal_connect`
//! shows that the alternative can be rather cumbersome.
//!
//! # Design overview
//!
//! While this file is fairly lengthy, the overall algorithm is simple.
//! On the first frame ever:
//! * Prepare an empty `arena_next`.
//! * Parse the incoming [`input::Input`] which should be a resize event.
//! * Create a new [`Context`] instance and give it the caller.
//! * Now the caller will draw their UI with the [`Context`] by calling the
//!   various [`Context`] UI methods, such as [`Context::block_begin()`] and
//!   [`Context::block_end()`]. These two are the basis which all other UI
//!   elements are built upon by the way. Each UI element that is created gets
//!   allocated onto `arena_next` and inserted into the UI tree.
//!   That tree works exactly like the DOM tree in HTML: Each node in the tree
//!   has a parent, children, and siblings. The tree layout at the end is then
//!   a direct mirror of the code "layout" that created it.
//! * Once the caller is done and drops the [`Context`], it'll secretly call
//!   `report_context_completion`. This causes a number of things:
//!   * The DOM tree that was built is stored in `prev_tree`.
//!   * A hashmap of all nodes is built and stored in `prev_node_map`.
//!   * `arena_next` is swapped with `arena_prev`.
//!   * Each UI node is measured and laid out.
//! * Now the caller is expected to repeat this process with a [`None`]
//!   input event until [`Tui::needs_settling()`] returns false.
//!   This is necessary, because when [`Context::button()`] returns `true`
//!   in one frame, it may change the state in the caller's code
//!   and require another frame to be drawn.
//! * Finally a call to [`Tui::render()`] will render the UI tree into the
//!   framebuffer and return VT output.
//!
//! On every subsequent frame the process is similar, but one crucial element
//! of any immediate mode UI framework is added:
//! Now when the caller draws their UI, the various [`Context`] UI elements
//! have access to `prev_node_map` and the previously built UI tree.
//! This allows the UI framework to reuse the previously computed layout for
//! hit tests, caching scroll offsets, and so on.
//!
//! In the end it looks very similar:
//! * Prepare an empty `arena_next`.
//! * Parse the incoming [`input::Input`]...
//!   * **BUT** now we can hit-test mouse clicks onto the previously built
//!     UI tree. This way we can delegate focus on left mouse clicks.
//! * Create a new [`Context`] instance and give it the caller.
//! * The caller draws their UI with the [`Context`]...
//!   * **BUT** we can preserve the UI state across frames.
//! * Continue rendering until [`Tui::needs_settling()`] returns false.
//! * And the final call to [`Tui::render()`].
//!
//! # Classnames and node IDs
//!
//! So how do we find which node from the previous tree correlates to the
//! current node? Each node needs to be constructed with a "classname".
//! The classname is hashed with the parent node ID as the seed. This derived
//! hash is then used as the new child node ID. Under the assumption that the
//! collision likelihood of the hash function is low, this serves as true IDs.
//!
//! This has the nice added property that finding a node with the same ID
//! guarantees that all of the parent nodes must have equivalent IDs as well.
//! This turns "is the focus anywhere inside this subtree" into an O(1) check.
//!
//! The reason "classnames" are used is because I was hoping to add theming
//! in the future with a syntax similar to CSS (simplified, however).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use edit::helpers::Size;
//! use edit::input::Input;
//! use edit::tui::*;
//! use stdext::{arena, arena_format};
//!
//! struct State {
//!     counter: i32,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     arena::init(128 * 1024 * 1024).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Create a `Tui` instance which holds state across frames.
//!     let mut tui = Tui::new().unwrap();
//!     let mut state = State { counter: 0 };
//!     let input = Input::Resize(Size { width: 80, height: 24 });
//!
//!     // Pass the input to the TUI.
//!     {
//!         let mut ctx = tui.create_context(Some(input));
//!         draw(&mut ctx, &mut state);
//!     }
//!
//!     // Continue until the layout has settled.
//!     while tui.needs_settling() {
//!         let mut ctx = tui.create_context(None);
//!         draw(&mut ctx, &mut state);
//!     }
//!
//!     // Render the output.
//!     let scratch = arena::scratch_arena(None);
//!     let output = tui.render(&*scratch);
//!     println!("{}", output);
//! }
//!
//! fn draw(ctx: &mut Context, state: &mut State) {
//!     ctx.table_begin("classname");
//!     {
//!         ctx.table_next_row();
//!
//!         // Thanks to the lack of callbacks, we can use a primitive
//!         // if condition here, as well as in any potential C code.
//!         if ctx.button("button", "Click me!", ButtonStyle::default()) {
//!             state.counter += 1;
//!         }
//!
//!         // Similarly, formatting and showing labels is straightforward.
//!         // It's impossible to forget updating the label this way.
//!         ctx.label("label", &arena_format!(ctx.arena(), "Counter: {}", state.counter));
//!     }
//!     ctx.table_end();
//! }
//! ```
